# CS231n-Assignment3-CV-Applications
This repository contains three Google Colab notebooks, each of which is a part assignment-3 of [CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) course by Stanford, Spring 2020.

I have inclued three questions from the [assignment-3](https://cs231n.github.io/assignments2020/assignment3/), which also serves as applications of Computer Vision algorithms.

1. Network Visualization (Saliency maps, Class Visualization, and Fooling Images)
2. Neural Style Transfer
3. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

All the three problems are implemented using the PyTorch framework.

You can view the CS231n course notes [here](https://cs231n.github.io/). 
Also the lecture series of the CS231n can be found below:
